## Quick Path vs Full Protocol

| Situation | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Clear error, obvious root cause, fix in <15 min | **Quick Path** (below) |
| Root cause unclear, multiple hypotheses | **Full Protocol** (Phase 1–5) |
| Distributed training issue (hang, wrong loss, sharding) | **Full Protocol** |
| Numerical accuracy / loss divergence | **Full Protocol** |
| 2+ failed fix attempts | **Full Protocol** |

### Quick Path

1. Reproduce the error. Read the full traceback.
2. Check `.agents/knowledge/constraints.md` for known pitfalls.
3. Write a reproducer test if feasible.
4. Minimal fix — root cause only, don't touch surrounding code.
5. Verify: reproducer passes, `pytest tests/<module>/` passes, no regressions across modalities.
6. Run `make quality`, commit. Run `/veomni-review` before opening the PR or pushing a substantive update, not per commit.

If not resolved in 15 min → switch to Full Protocol.

## Full Protocol

### Before You Start

Track the phases with whatever todo/plan tool the running agent provides:

```
Phase 1: Investigate <symptom>       -> in_progress
Phase 2: Pattern analysis            -> pending
Phase 3: Hypothesis & test           -> pending
Phase 4: Implement fix               -> pending
Phase 5: Knowledge capture           -> pending
```

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

1. Read the FULL error message / symptom. Don't skim. Extract 2-3 keywords.
2. **Check constraints first**: Read `.agents/knowledge/constraints.md` — many issues are known constraint violations.
3. Reproduce consistently. If you can't reproduce, you don't understand it.
4. `git log --oneline -10` — what changed recently?
5. Trace data flow backward through the call stack.
6. **Distributed training specifics**:
   - Check if error appears on all ranks or just rank 0.
   - FSDP2: verify sharding plan matches model structure (`veomni/distributed/parallel_plan.py`).
   - Sequence parallel: check that attention inputs are properly split/gathered (`veomni/distributed/sequence_parallel/`).
   - MoE: verify expert routing and load balancing (`veomni/distributed/moe/`).

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. Find a **working** example (previous commit, different config, reference implementation).
2. Compare **completely** — diff line by line, not skim. Include config YAML, environment vars, and launcher scripts.
3. Identify ALL differences between working and broken code.
4. Check dependencies — different transformers version? Different PyTorch version?
5. **If a package version upgrade is suspected**, create isolated uv environments to bisect:
   ```bash
   # Env A: the current default pin (the `transformers-stable` group).
   uv venv .venv-a
   VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv-a uv sync --active --extra gpu --dev

   # Env B: the same tree with exactly one package moved.
   uv venv .venv-b
   VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv-b uv sync --active --extra gpu --dev
   VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv-b uv pip install "<package>==<other-version>"
   ```
   `--active` is load-bearing. Without it `uv sync` runs in project mode and
   targets `.venv/`, ignoring `VIRTUAL_ENV` — so both commands would rebuild
   the main environment instead of the two you just created, which is the
   opposite of what this is for. (`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` works too.)

   Confirm that installing the alternate version did not change other packages:
   ```bash
   uv pip freeze --python .venv-a/bin/python > /tmp/veomni-bisect-a.freeze
   uv pip freeze --python .venv-b/bin/python > /tmp/veomni-bisect-b.freeze
   diff -u /tmp/veomni-bisect-a.freeze /tmp/veomni-bisect-b.freeze
   ```
   Only the target package may differ. Pin or restore every non-target
   difference in Env B to Env A's version, then compare again before running
   the reproducer. If the target cannot run with that dependency set, report
   the compatibility conflict; a multi-package change is not a one-package bisect.

   Then run the same reproducer in both envs, each with its own env
   *activated* — the `VIRTUAL_ENV=` prefixes above apply only to the `uv sync`
   lines they are attached to, not to whatever you run next:
   ```bash
   (source .venv-a/bin/activate && <reproducer>)
   (source .venv-b/bin/activate && <reproducer>)
   ```

   **If the suspect package is transformers, you need two worktrees *and* two
   venvs — one venv per worktree.** They isolate different things and neither
   substitutes for the other: a venv isolates the installed packages, a
   worktree isolates the checkout. `generated/` modeling lives in the
   checkout, so two venvs in one worktree share a single `generated/` and
   regenerating it for Env B silently changes what Env A runs. Two worktrees
   without separate venvs share one transformers install, which defeats the
   bisect outright.
   ```bash
   git worktree add ../bisect-a HEAD && (cd ../bisect-a && uv venv .venv && VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv sync --active --extra gpu --dev)
   git worktree add ../bisect-b HEAD && (cd ../bisect-b && uv venv .venv && VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv sync --active --extra gpu --dev && VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv pip install "transformers==<other-version>")
   ```
   Regenerate `generated/` inside each worktree against its own pin
   (`make patchgen`) before running the reproducer — it is produced against
   the pinned version, and a stale `generated/` is itself a source of
   failures.

   Compare the package sets here too, using `uv pip freeze --python` with
   `../bisect-a/.venv/bin/python` and `../bisect-b/.venv/bin/python`, and
   reconcile non-transformers dependency version differences as above. The
   editable VeOmni and patchgen paths must point to their respective worktrees;
   normalize those corresponding paths only when comparing the freeze output,
   without changing either environment's editable installs. Run codegen and
   the reproducer from each worktree with its own environment activated:
   ```bash
   (cd ../bisect-a && source .venv/bin/activate && make patchgen && <reproducer>)
   (cd ../bisect-b && source .venv/bin/activate && make patchgen && <reproducer>)
   ```

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. Form ONE specific, falsifiable hypothesis.
2. Design a MINIMAL experiment (change one thing only).
3. Run the experiment. Record the result.
4. If wrong, update understanding and form new hypothesis. No random guess-and-check.

**Verification gate** — before acting on a conclusion, check:
- Does the evidence actually support this cause, or just correlate?
- Could a different root cause produce the same symptoms?
- What observation would disprove this hypothesis? Have you looked for it?
- If confidence < 80% or the evidence is ambiguous, launch a verification subagent (see Appendix).

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. Write a failing test that demonstrates the bug (if feasible).
2. Implement a SINGLE targeted fix addressing the root cause.
3. Verify: test passes, training runs correctly, no regressions.
4. Check for collateral — did the fix break other modalities or trainers?
5. Before opening the PR or pushing a substantive update: run `/veomni-review` over the branch diff.

### Phase 5: Knowledge Capture (mandatory)

**Do this immediately after the fix is verified.** Knowledge decays fast.

- [ ] **New hard constraint?** → add to `.agents/knowledge/constraints.md`
- [ ] **Architecture insight?** → add to `.agents/knowledge/architecture.md`
- [ ] **Regression guard needed?** → prefer adding a case to an existing
      CI-enumerated test; see `.agents/knowledge/testing.md`. Only paths not
      already covered by a directory-level CI entry need a new workflow line.
      Use the workflow that owns the path, including the e2e workflows for
      end-to-end tests; account for the GPU/NPU differences in that table.
- [ ] **Docs outdated?** → update `docs/` if the fix changes API behavior, config semantics, or usage patterns

If none apply, explicitly note "no new knowledge to capture."

## Stop Conditions

Restart from Phase 1 if you catch yourself thinking "let me just try changing X
and see", "quick fix for now, clean up later", or "it probably works, moving on".

After **3 consecutive failed fix attempts**, stop fixing symptoms. Question
whether the underlying approach is wrong, re-examine whether you are solving the
right problem, and report the analysis to the user before continuing.

## Common Pitfalls

- **FSDP2 + gradient accumulation**: gradients must be accumulated in the unsharded space — accumulating sharded gradients produces wrong results.
- **DCP checkpoint format**: model state dict keys must match exactly between save and load — renamed parameters break checkpoint loading silently.
- **Multi-modality data collators**: text-only collators crash on multimodal data and vice versa — always check `data_collator` type matches the dataset.
- **Sequence parallel**: attention outputs must be gathered before loss computation — partial outputs produce incorrect loss values.
- **Patchgen**: model patches in `veomni/models/transformers/*/` are auto-generated — editing generated files directly will be overwritten.

## Domain-Specific Checklists

Include the relevant checklist when investigating.

### Distributed Training Correctness
- [ ] Is the loss identical (within tolerance) between 1-GPU and multi-GPU runs?
- [ ] Are ALL model parameters sharded correctly? (check parallel_plan)
- [ ] Is gradient clipping applied in the correct coordinate space?
- [ ] For sequence parallel: are attention masks split consistently across ranks?
- [ ] For MoE: are expert assignments deterministic across runs with the same seed?

### Numerical Correctness
- [ ] Is there a reference implementation showing the SAME numbers?
- [ ] Are ALL weights loaded? (check logs for missing/unexpected keys)
- [ ] Is the comparison fair? (same inputs, same dtype, same parallelism)
- [ ] Could there be a dtype mismatch? (float32 vs bfloat16 in computation)
- [ ] Are there NaN/Inf values being silently masked or replaced?

## Appendix: Verification Subagent

When confidence is low or evidence is ambiguous, launch a subagent to challenge your conclusion:

```
You are a critical reviewer. Your job is to find flaws in the following conclusion.

## Conclusion Under Review
<the specific claim or decision>

## Evidence Presented
<the data, logs, experiments supporting the conclusion>

## Your Task
1. Does the evidence actually support the conclusion, or just correlate?
2. Generate 2+ alternative explanations consistent with the same evidence.
3. What specific observation would DISPROVE this conclusion? Has it been checked?
4. Was the experiment controlled (one variable changed at a time)?

## Output
Verdict: CONFIRMED / CHALLENGED / INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
Findings: [issues found, counter-hypotheses, missing evidence]
```
