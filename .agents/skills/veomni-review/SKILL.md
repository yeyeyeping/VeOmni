description: "Pre-PR code review gate. Run before opening a pull request, and again before pushing a substantive update to an open one — not per commit. Required when the PR's branch diff touches Python under veomni/, tasks/ or tests/, or CI workflows, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, docker/ or configs/. Also trigger proactively for runtime or configuration changes that span multiple files, touch shared infrastructure (BaseTrainer, distributed, model loading, data pipeline, ops dispatch), or have uncertain safety. Docs, comments and .agents/-only changes use the self-check below. The review launches a subagent that checks implementation quality, multi-file consistency, and known constraint violations, then rates the change as safe/needs-attention/risky."

## When this gate applies

**Once per PR, not once per commit.** The unit that lands is the pull request,
so that is the unit worth reviewing: the reviewer sees the whole change instead
of a slice of it, and a branch of ten commits costs one review rather than ten.
Run it again before pushing a substantive update to an open PR — not for a
typo fix or a rebase.

Commits stay cheap: `make quality` and your own verification still gate every
commit, and nothing stops you invoking this mid-branch when a change worries
you. It is the *obligation* that moved, not the option.

| The PR's branch diff touches | Review |
|--------|--------|
| Python under `veomni/`, `tasks/`, `tests/` | Required |
| `.github/workflows/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `docker/`, `configs/` | Required |
| Docs, comments, or `.agents/` knowledge and skills only | Skip — self-check instead: verify every repo path, config key and version you assert actually exists |
| A clean, exact revert or reapplication of a previously approved diff, with no additional or conflict-resolved changes | Skip |

Partial reverts and reapplications with extra edits or conflict resolutions
must follow the normal review gate; prior approval does not cover those changes.

Skipping means skipping the subagent, not skipping verification. Say which
branch you took, so the reader knows a review happened or why it didn't.

## Steps

1. Capture the diff the PR will actually contain — the whole branch against the
   base it targets, not the working tree:
   ```bash
   git diff <base>...HEAD          # <base> is the branch the PR targets
   ```
   Use three dots: it diffs from the merge base, so commits that landed on
   `<base>` after you branched do not show up as your changes. `<base>` is
   usually `main`, but for a stacked PR it is the branch below yours — diffing
   against `main` there would hand the reviewer every PR under you as well.

   If you still have uncommitted work you want included, add it too, and note
   that a plain `git diff` sees neither staged nor untracked files:
   ```bash
   git add -N .                    # intent-to-add: new files become visible, stages no content
   git diff HEAD
   ```
   `git diff HEAD` covers staged and unstaged tracked files; `git add -N` is
   what makes a brand-new module or test visible at all, and it respects
   `.gitignore` so build artifacts stay out.
2. Read `.agents/knowledge/constraints.md` for known constraints.
3. **Launch a review subagent** with your agent's subagent/task mechanism (see
   the prompt below). The subagent receives only the diff + constraints — NOT
   your reasoning — to avoid confirmation bias. Point it at the diff command
   rather than pasting, so it reads the current state.
4. Act on the verdict.

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **safe** | Open or update the PR |
| **needs-attention** | Address the listed issues, then open or update the PR |
| **risky** | Output the report, do NOT open the PR, wait for the user |

5. Run `make quality` before pushing. (It gates every commit anyway, but this
   is the last chance before the diff is public.)

## Subagent Launch

Launch a subagent with this prompt. Use whatever the running agent calls it —
`Task`, `spawn_agent`, or an equivalent — and give it read-only access to the
repo so it can verify claims against the actual files.

```
You are a code reviewer for VeOmni, a distributed multi-modality training framework. Your job is to find problems in the following diff. You are NOT validating the author's intent — you are looking for bugs, risks, and constraint violations.

## Review Checklist

For each changed file, check:

### Implementation Quality
- Hidden risks or edge cases not handled?
- Simpler alternative that achieves the same result?
- Boundary conditions (tensor shapes, distributed rank handling, gradient accumulation steps)?
- Does the fix depend on downstream code to "clean up"?

### Multi-file Consistency
- If a Trainer method changed, do all subclasses need matching changes?
- If model loading changed, are configs and parallel plans updated?
- If data collator changed, do all modalities still work?
- If distributed code changed, are the FSDP2, sequence-parallel and ExtraParallel/EP paths all handled? (FSDP1 no longer exists — a diff that adds an FSDP1 branch is itself a finding.)
- If a trainer lifecycle hook changed, do the composed trainers that override `forward_backward_step()` (`TextDPOTrainer`, `DiTTrainer`) still get it?

### Constraint Violations
- Does this violate any entry in the known-constraints list?
- Does this repeat a pattern that previously caused bugs?

### VeOmni-Specific Checks
- PR title format: `[{modules}] {type}: {description}`?
- All comments and docstrings in English?
- No auto-generated files (`veomni/models/transformers/*/generated/`) edited directly?
- Tests: does the diff extend an existing CI-enumerated test, or add a new file that the workflow owning that path actually lists? Check the owning workflow rather than assuming — `tests/data/` runs wholesale in both unit workflows, `tests/ops/` only in the GPU one (NPU enumerates ops files by name, so an Ascend-relevant ops file still needs a line), the e2e paths belong to `{gpu,npu}_e2e_test.yml`, and everything else must be listed file by file or it never runs. See `.agents/knowledge/testing.md`.
- Ruff-compliant (`make quality` passes)?

## Output

### Verdict: safe / needs-attention / risky

### Findings (for needs-attention or risky)
For each issue:
- **File**: path:line
- **Concern**: what could go wrong
- **Suggestion**: what to do instead
```

## After Commit

- Run `make quality` to confirm ruff compliance.
- Verify PR title follows `[{modules}] {type}: {description}` format.
