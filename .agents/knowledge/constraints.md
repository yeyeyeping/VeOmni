# Hard Constraints

Violating any of these causes silent bugs, crashes, or incorrect training results. Check before every code change.

## Model Loading & Registry

1. **Model registration must happen at import time**
   - `MODELING_REGISTRY`, `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY`, and `MODEL_PROCESSOR_REGISTRY` in `veomni/models/loader.py` are populated when model `__init__.py` files are imported.
   - Moving registrations into functions or delaying them breaks `build_foundation_model()`.
   - All model `__init__.py` files must import and register their modeling classes at module level.

2. **Model config `model_type` must match registry key**
   - The `model_type` field in a model's `config.json` is used as the lookup key in registries.
   - Mismatches cause fallback to vanilla HuggingFace loading, which misses VeOmni patches (flash attention, sequence parallel).

3. **Patchgen-generated files must not be edited manually**
   - Files under `veomni/models/transformers/*/generated/` are created by the `patchgen` CLI (entry point installed by the `patchgen` package).
   - Manual edits are silently overwritten on the next patchgen run.
   - To change generated behavior, edit the patch spec (`patch_spec.py`) or the modeling patch file (`modeling_*_patch.py`).

4. **Transformers version: pinned to v5.9.0**
   - VeOmni installs `transformers==5.9.0` via the `transformers-stable`
     default dependency group in `pyproject.toml`.
   - The legacy v4 path was removed; all modeling under
     `veomni/models/transformers/<m>/` is patchgen-generated.
   - `is_transformers_version_greater_or_equal_to()` from
     `veomni/utils/import_utils.py` is retained only for forward-looking
     gates (for HF APIs newer than the current pin) — do **not** add new
     version gates for versions `<= 5.9.0` (the legacy `>= 5.0.0` …
     `>= 5.8.x` interval is dead code).
   - Patchgen regeneration must be done with `transformers==5.9.0` installed.

## Distributed Training

VeOmni uses FSDP2 exclusively. FSDP1 has been removed.

Core entry points:
- `veomni/distributed/parallel_state.py` — `init_parallel_state_from_config()`, `ParallelState` dataclass
- `veomni/distributed/torch_parallelize.py` — `build_parallelize_model()`, `parallelize_model_fsdp2()`
- `veomni/distributed/parallel_plan.py` — `ParallelPlan`, `SpecInfo`

### FSDP2

5. **FSDP2 uses PyTorch composable `fully_shard()` API**
   - `parallelize_model_fsdp2()` in `torch_parallelize.py` calls `fully_shard()` on each transformer block, then on the root model.
   - The FSDP mesh comes from `ParallelState.fsdp_mesh`, which is a view of the global device mesh (can be `dp_shard`, `dp_shard_sp`, or include `dp_replicate` for HSDP).
   - When SP is enabled, the FSDP shard mesh fuses with the SP mesh (`dp_shard_sp`) so sequence-parallel ranks co-shard via FSDP.
   - Gradient clipping: `veomni/distributed/fsdp2/clip_grad_norm.py` — handles DTensor grads and ExtraParallel param groups.

6. **Device mesh initialization (`init_parallel_state_from_config()`)**
   - Builds a global `DeviceMesh` with named dimensions: `pp`, `dp_replicate`, `dp_shard`, `ulysses`, `cp`, `tp` (each included only if size > 1).
   - Flattens subviews for common usage: `dp` (all data-parallel), `sp` (ulysses+cp), `dp_shard_sp` (FSDP shard × SP), `dp_sp` (for loss/grad sync across SP+DP).
   - For each ExtraParallel name (e.g. `ep`), builds a `[para_size × para_fsdp_size]` submesh via `init_para_mesh_matrix()`.

### Sequence Parallel (Ulysses)

7. **SP uses all-to-all head/sequence exchange, not all-gather**
   - Implementation: `veomni/distributed/sequence_parallel/ulysses.py`
   - `gather_seq_scatter_heads(qkv)` — before attention: each rank sends sequence chunks, receives head chunks → **full sequence, subset of heads** per rank.
   - `gather_heads_scatter_seq(output)` — after attention: inverse exchange → **full heads, subset of sequence** per rank.
   - Underlying primitive: `_SeqAllToAll` (autograd-aware `all_to_all_tensor`).
   - Async variants in `async_ulysses*.py` for DiT and pipelined QKV/output projections.
   - Data slicing: `veomni/distributed/sequence_parallel/data.py` — `sp_pad_and_slice()`, `slice_input_tensor()`, `gather_outputs()`.
   - Loss reduction: `reduce_sequence_parallel_loss()` in `loss.py` aggregates across SP ranks (optional `group=` arg; defaults to the current state's unified SP group).
   - Process groups: `comm.py` has NO group globals. Its getters (`get_ulysses_sequence_parallel_group`, `get_unified_sequence_parallel_group`, `get_context_parallel_group`, `get_data_parallel_group`) resolve from the *current* `ParallelState`'s device mesh (`get_parallel_state().{ulysses,sp,cp,dp}_group`) — exactly how `fsdp_group` already worked. `set_ulysses_sequence_parallel_group(group)` survives ONLY as a unit-test injection seam (`_ULYSSES_SP_GROUP_OVERRIDE`, `None` in production); no production code calls it. Meshless SP is unsupported — `ParallelState.__post_init__` raises if `sp_enabled and device_mesh is None`; always build via `init_parallel_state_from_config`.
   - Local parallel state: `BaseTrainer._setup()` calls `init_parallel_state_from_config(args.model.accelerator, name="base")` **before** seed/determinism env vars (`NCCL_DETERMINISTIC`, etc.). Initialization caches by topology and registers under `name`; duplicate name → warn and return existing. Trainers do not store the ParallelState object or name — use `use_parallel_state("base")` / `get_parallel_state_by_name("base")`. `clear_parallel_state()` after `destroy_process_group()`. Tests that need a topology no job config can express call `_init_parallel_state` directly.
   - **Build scope**: `_setup()` (registers `"base"`) → one `with use_parallel_state("base"):` around the whole build sequence. Do NOT re-wrap individual build helpers.
   - **Run scope (per-op, not whole `train_step`)**: each ambient-dependent op gets its own wrap with `"base"` — `model` forward, `postforward`/`mean_global_loss`, `loss.backward()`, `veomni_clip_grad_norm`. When an API takes explicit `group=`, pass `get_parallel_state_by_name("base").sp_group` and skip ambient.
   - **Callbacks**: cache `Callback.parallel_state` at construction (ChannelLossComputer too). Hook dispatch must not depend on ambient ParallelState.
   - See `docs/design/local_parallel_state.md`.

7a. **DDP under SP: average grads over `fsdp_group` before clipping, and never broadcast buffers**
   - `build_parallelize_model()` wraps DDP with `process_group=dp_group`. Enabling Ulysses shrinks `dp` (`dp_size = world / sp_size`), so at `dp_size == 1` DDP's all-reduce is a no-op while each rank still holds gradients from only its `1/sp` slice of the sequence — the optimizer then steps on a partial gradient, silently, with no shape error. `veomni_clip_grad_norm()` therefore all-reduces `p.grad` over `fsdp_group` (`dp_sp`) and divides by the group size before clipping whenever `dp_mode == "ddp"` and `sp_size > 1`. FSDP2 does not have this bug because it already reduces over `fsdp_group`; `dp_sp` spans `dp_replicate × dp_shard × ulysses × cp`, so one reduction covers plain DP, HSDP and SP alike and leaves the two dp modes numerically equivalent. Reducing over `dp_sp` on top of DDP's own `dp` reduction is not a double count — every rank of a `dp` group enters with the same value, so the second average reproduces the plain mean over `dp_sp`. Any new grad-clip entry point that can see a DDP-wrapped module owes the same reduction.
   - Reduce with `SUM` then divide — **not** `ReduceOp.AVG`, which the NPU backend does not support (same reason as `veomni/utils/dist_utils.py::all_reduce`).
   - Reduce over `dp_sp` even though `sp` alone would be arithmetically identical whenever DDP has already averaged over `dp` (every rank of a `dp` group then holds the same value, so the `dp` extent contributes nothing). `dp_sp` costs a wider group — `dp` is usually the cross-node dimension — and buys independence from *whether* DDP reduced: `no_sync()`-style gradient accumulation, which nothing uses today, would leave `dp` peers unreduced at clip time and make the narrow version silently wrong in exactly the way this constraint exists to prevent. Revisit only with a benchmark. Both versions issue one collective per parameter tensor, uncoalesced; bucketing (as DDP itself does at 25 MB) is the obvious optimization if this ever shows up in a profile.
   - Select the gradients to reduce by `requires_grad`, not by `grad is not None`, and zero-fill a missing one. It is one collective per gradient, so a parameter that goes unused on some ranks only would otherwise desynchronize the sequence and hang. The fill is unreachable today — the wrap sets no `find_unused_parameters`, so DDP's own reducer already fails on an unused trainable parameter before the clip runs — and keying on `requires_grad` is what keeps the reduction correct rather than dependent on that.
   - Convert a DTensor grad norm with `full_tensor()` before `.item()`, as the FSDP2 path does: `.item()` on a sharded or partial DTensor reads this rank's piece rather than the global norm. Only the *reported* norm is at stake — `clip_grad_norm_()` computes and applies the clip internally, and does so globally for DTensors. Defensive either way: `build_parallelize_model()` calls `parallelize_module()` with no `parallelize_plan`, which torch warns about and treats as a no-op, so nothing on the DDP path is a DTensor today. Same for the `to_local()` in `_allreduce_ddp_sp_grads()`.
   - Pass `broadcast_buffers=False` **unconditionally**, never conditioned on `sp_size`. FSDP2/HSDP performs *no* buffer sync at all (`torch.distributed.fsdp` contains no `_sync_module_states` / `_broadcast_coalesced`; `fully_shard` only places buffers on the device). A module's buffer semantics must not change with the `fsdp_mode` a config happened to pick.
   - Nothing is lost. Config-derived buffers (SigLIP `position_ids`, static rope tables) are already identical on every rank, and dynamic-rope `inv_freq` is deliberately recomputed from *this* rank's sequence length by `modeling_rope_utils.py` — pushing rank0's copy would actively corrupt the others. Buffers get no gradients, so the gradient all-reduce above is not a fallback for them; but neither is the broadcast.
   - Genuinely replicated mutable state (`nn.BatchNorm*` running stats) is not fixed by `broadcast_buffers=True` either: it overwrites every rank with rank0's copy, i.e. discards the other ranks' statistics rather than aggregating them. `SyncBatchNorm` is the real fix — it all-reduces the statistics inside forward, so it holds under DDP, FSDP2 and HSDP alike; under SP its `process_group` must span dp+sp, since Ulysses splits the sequence and `dp_group` excludes the SP peers. The repo has zero `nn.BatchNorm*` and zero `nn.SyncBatchNorm` today — the single instance lived in the `janus` model deleted with the SeedOmni V1 stack — so this is a rule for new code rather than a live bug: a `SyncBatchNorm` added on the default world group needs that `process_group` argument before it is trained under SP.

7b. **DDP must materialize and load meta-init weights itself, before the wrap**
   - `model.accelerator.init_device` defaults to `"meta"` and only `fsdp_mode == "fsdp2"` is asserted to use it, so a `ddp` config reaches `build_parallelize_model()` with an empty model. DDP registers gradient hooks and broadcasts rank0's parameters, but it materializes nothing and loads nothing, and `BaseTrainer` has no load step of its own — so `parallelize_model_ddp()` owns that pass, exactly as `parallelize_model_fsdp2()` does. Both call `_materialize_and_load_weights()`, which is the single place where the choice between random init, an HF snapshot and a checkpoint resume is made; a new dp mode owes the same call. Omit it and DDP's constructor dies on `Tensor.item() cannot be called on meta tensors`.
   - The gate is `param.is_meta`, not `init_device`. The flag states an intent the model builder is free to ignore — `tests/data/*` construct their model eagerly and leave the flag at its `meta` default — and materializing a model that already holds real weights discards them, or raises outright on a plain `nn.Module` with no `init_weights`. A model built under `cuda` arrives with weights already loaded (`empty_init=False` in `veomni/models/auto.py`) and must be left alone. `parallelize_model_fsdp2()` keeps its call unconditional because `arguments_types.py` asserts `init_device == "meta"` for fsdp2, so a real model cannot reach it.
   - `init_device == "cpu"` is refused for `ddp`, by an assert in `AcceleratorConfig._validate_init_device()` alongside the one that pins fsdp2 to `meta` — not in `parallelize_model_ddp()`. Parse time is the right place: every rank fails together, before a model is built or a snapshot read. It never worked for the wrap: `device_ids=[local_rank]` has been passed since the first commit, and torch rejects that together with a CPU module (`torch/nn/parallel/distributed.py`), so rank0's CPU replica cannot be wrapped while every other rank builds empty and skips the load (`veomni/models/loader.py`). It was FSDP1's `sync_module_states` recipe (rank0 reads, the wrapper broadcasts), dropped in #756; fsdp2 replaced it with `broadcast_model_weights_from_rank0`.
   - Dropping `"cpu"` from the field's `Literal` is *not* what enforces this, and no `Literal` in the arguments layer enforces anything. The parser turns it into argparse `choices`, which covers the CLI only; a YAML value goes straight to the dataclass constructor via `_instantiate_recursive()` (`veomni/arguments/parser.py`), and annotations are never checked at runtime. Any config value that must actually be rejected needs an explicit assert in `__post_init__`.
   - Two other users of `"cpu"` are unaffected and must not be swept up in that: `build_foundation_model(init_device="cpu")` is a live public API (several tests build on CPU that way), and `materialize_device="cpu"` is how fsdp2 CPU offload reaches `load_model_weights()`. The `init_device` parameters in `veomni/models/module_utils.py` are fed by the latter, not by `model.accelerator.init_device`.
   - `should_skip_hf_weight_load` must be honoured here too: a distributed-checkpoint resume is about to overwrite every parameter, so reading the HF snapshot doubles peak memory, and the snapshot may not exist at all.
   - `broadcast_model_weights_from_rank0` is honoured here, and the `AcceleratorConfig._validate_init_device()` warning that used to call it fsdp2-only is gone. That warning was correct only while DDP loaded nothing at all; now that this path loads, the flag applies verbatim — `rank0_load_and_broadcast_weights()` broadcasts over the default (world) group from global rank0 (`dist.broadcast(..., src=0)`, no `group=`), and a DDP replica wants exactly that whole tensor. It defaults to `True`, so ignoring it would have pinned every DDP run to the every-rank-reads path while printing that it was being ignored.
   - After the load pass, `parallelize_model_ddp()` re-checks `param.is_meta` and raises with the offending parameter names. A loader that leaves one behind would otherwise surface inside DDP's constructor as `Tensor.item() cannot be called on meta tensors`, which names neither the parameter nor the cause.
   - ExtraParallel is refused on the DDP path, keyed on **the model's plan** (`_has_extra_parallel_plan()`), not on `ParallelState.any_extra_parallel_enabled`. Only `parallelize_model_fsdp2()` applies the plan that shards expert weights, so DDP experts are whole and loading a sharded-expert config into them — previously prevented only by the meta crash — would silently produce full tensors. But the mesh alone does not identify such a model: a SeedOmni V2 sub-module's accelerator is `_deep_update(global, override)`, so a DDP vision tower inherits the backbone's ep dim while owning no experts, and refusing on the mesh would block it. The same predicate gates `ep_sharded_stream_load` in `_materialize_and_load_weights()`: a plan-less model skips the fast path with a log line (there was never one to take), while a model that *does* have a plan still lets the loader's `NotImplementedError` propagate, because that one means the checkpoint layout is unsupported — the distinction `tests/utils/test_moe_ep_sharded_load_matrix.py` pins for `nonmerged x ep_sharded`.

### Expert Parallel (MoE)

8. **EP shards expert weights and exchanges tokens via all-to-all**
   - Weight sharding: `ParallelPlan` in `parallel_plan.py` defines which expert parameters get `Shard(0)` on the EP mesh. `ParallelPlan.apply()` wraps matching params as DTensors and redistributes to local shards.
   - Token routing: `veomni/distributed/moe/moe_layer.py` — `preprocess()` computes dispatch counts, `token_pre_all2all()` / `tokens_post_all2all()` exchange tokens between EP ranks via `all_to_all` / `all_to_all_async` in `moe/comm.py`.
   - Expert computation: `EPGroupGemm` runs fused expert MLP on grouped tokens per rank.
   - Device mesh: `init_parallel_state_from_config()` builds `[ep × ep_fsdp]` submesh; accessed via `ParallelState.extra_parallel_mesh("ep")`, `ep_group`, `ep_rank`.
   - In FSDP2: expert modules get `fully_shard()` on the `ep_fsdp` submesh with `Shard(1)` placement so hidden-dim sharding composes with EP's dim-0 sharding.

## Data Pipeline

Core files:
- `veomni/data/data_collator.py` — `MainCollator` (3-stage pipeline)
- `veomni/data/dynamic_batching.py` — sample packing with token budgets
- `veomni/data/data_transform.py` — dataset transform registry
- `veomni/data/chat_template.py` — chat template with label masking
- `veomni/utils/seqlen_pos_transform_utils.py` — FA kwargs computation

### MainCollator Pipeline

9. **MainCollator is a 3-stage pipeline, not a single function**
   - Stage 1: `PrecomputePositionIDsCollator` — fills `position_ids = torch.arange(seq_len)` if absent.
   - Stage 2: `PackingCollator` — concatenates micro-batch samples along sequence dim using `DataCollateInfo` rules from `DEFAULT_DATA_COLLATE_INFO`. Sets `labels[0]` of each non-first sample to `IGNORE_INDEX` at pack boundaries.
   - Stage 3: `SequenceParallelCollator` (only when SP enabled) — label shift, SP padding/slicing, FA kwargs, then position_ids slicing.

### Conventions

10. **`position_ids == 0` marks segment boundaries for FlashAttention varlen**
    - `add_flash_attention_kwargs_from_position_ids()` finds indices where `position_ids == 0` → builds `cu_seq_lens_q/k` for `flash_attn_varlen`.
    - These must be in the batch dict **before** the model forward pass. Recomputing per-layer causes host-device sync.
    - Multimodal models may have 3D position_ids `(B, dim, L)` — FA uses the first row `[:, 0, :]`.

11. **Dynamic batching token counting must match `dyn_bsz_count_mode`**
    - Default / legacy behavior (`train.dyn_bsz_count_mode="total"`) uses `attention_mask.sum()` as the length function in `DynamicBatchingSizeDataset` and `DynBszBuffer`.
    - Optional effective-token mode (`"effective"`) uses `(labels != IGNORE_INDEX).sum()` when `labels` are present, and falls back to `attention_mask.sum()` otherwise.
    - With FA varlen, `attention_mask` is still expected to be all-ones over packed length; boundaries come from `position_ids` and `cu_seq_lens`.
    - When SP is enabled, `attention_mask` must use `sp_pad_value=1` (asserted in `MainCollator.__post_init__`).
    - In effective-token mode, dynamic batching still applies a hard physical-token cap of `micro_batch_size * max_seq_len` during micro-batch selection to avoid unbounded prompt-heavy batches; a single sample may still exceed the cap by itself and should be controlled by preprocessing.

12. **`IGNORE_INDEX` (-100) for loss masking**
    - Labels set to `IGNORE_INDEX` are excluded from loss computation.
    - Chat templates set `IGNORE_INDEX` on non-target turns (prompts, system messages).
    - `PackingCollator` sets `IGNORE_INDEX` on the first token of each packed sample (after the first) to prevent cross-sample supervision.
    - Custom data transforms must preserve this convention.

13. **SP collation ordering is load-bearing**
    - `SequenceParallelCollator` executes in strict order: pad → slice batch tensors → compute FA kwargs on **full** `position_ids` → slice `position_ids` last.
    - Reordering causes incorrect `cu_seq_lens` or misaligned position/label tensors.

14. **Dynamic batching packs samples by token budget**
    - `DynamicBatchingSizeDataset` (preferred) / `DynBszBuffer` (legacy): per-worker buffer, yields when token sum ≥ `micro_batch_seq_length`.
    - `_get_micro_batch` greedily adds samples that fit. Supports `state_dict` / `load_state_dict` for checkpoint resumption.
    - Position IDs in packed sequences must encode segment boundaries (see constraint 10).

### Multimodal Data

15. **Multimodal preprocessing pipeline (`veomni/data/multimodal/` + `veomni/data/data_transform.py`)**
    - The two orchestrators differ in where tokenization and label masking happen — do not assume a single shared order.
      - `process_sample_qwen_vl()`: `conv_preprocess()` → `fetch_images` / `fetch_videos_metadata` → `processor.image_processor` / `processor.video_processor` for pixel features only → `chat_template.encode_messages()`, which does **both** tokenization and label masking.
      - `process_sample_qwen_omni()`: takes no chat template. `conv_preprocess()` → `fetch_images/videos/audios` → `processor(text=..., images=..., videos=..., audios=...)` for tokenization → labels masked inline by a user/assistant token scan.
    - Images: load → RGB PIL → `smart_resize` (pixel min/max, scale_factor for grid alignment, max aspect ratio).
    - Videos: `torchcodec` decode → `calculate_frame_indices` (FPS, min/max frames, `frame_factor`/`frame_factor_remainder` for VAE-friendly counts); optional paired audio.
    - Audio: `librosa` at configurable `sample_rate` (default 16kHz).
    - Placeholder IDs: `veomni/utils/constants.py` defines the negative placeholders (`IMAGE_INPUT_INDEX = -200`, `VIDEO_INPUT_INDEX = -300`, `AUDIO_INPUT_INDEX = -400`; `TYPE2INDEX` groups them by input/output). `MultimodalChatTemplate` writes them into `input_ids`, and `process_sample_qwen_vl()` derives `image_mask` / `video_mask` from them, then zeroes the placeholders before text embedding. `process_sample_qwen_omni()` instead derives `image_mask` / `video_mask` / `audio_mask` from the model's own multimodal token ids. The mask keys are `{modality}_mask` — the V1 `{modality}_{input|output}_mask` convention went away with the SeedOmni V1 stack.

## Checkpoint

16. **DCP checkpoint keys must match model state dict**
    - `veomni/checkpoint/dcp_checkpointer.py` uses PyTorch's DCP (`torch.distributed.checkpoint`).
    - Renaming model parameters or changing the model structure between save and load breaks checkpoint loading.
    - Extra state is saved per-rank via `_EXTRA_STATE_FORMAT` — changing rank count requires checkpoint resharding.

17. **Checkpoint save/load requires all ranks to participate**
    - DCP operations are collective — all ranks must call save/load simultaneously.
    - Calling checkpoint operations from only rank 0 causes deadlocks.

18. **Distributed HF safetensors consolidation must support non-floating tensors**
    - PyTorch 2.9–2.11 computes consolidated tensor byte sizes with `torch.finfo`, which crashes for valid integer and boolean buffers such as DeepSeek V4 `tid2eid`.
    - `apply_dcp_consolidation_patch()` in `veomni/checkpoint/dcp_consolidation.py` replaces the metadata parser with `Tensor.element_size()` and verifies the upstream private-function source hash before patching.
    - Offline DCP-to-HF conversion may cast `save_dtype` only onto floating tensors; integer and boolean buffers must retain their original dtype, and shard-size planning must use their original element sizes.
    - Do not remove this patch during torch upgrades until the new upstream consolidator is verified with sharded integer-tensor save/load coverage.

## Code Quality

19. **Ruff must pass before commit**
    - `make quality` runs `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`.
    - Pre-commit hooks enforce this automatically (`pre-commit run --all-files`).

20. **All comments and docstrings must be in English**
    - No Chinese or other non-English text in code comments. This is enforced by project convention.

21. **PR title must follow format: `[{modules}] {type}: {description}`**
    - Allowed modules and types are defined in `.github/workflows/check_pr_title.yml` (single source of truth).
    - CI checks PR titles automatically on every PR.

## Hardware

22. **Non-CUDA accelerator code paths require guards**
    - There are three backends today: CUDA, Ascend NPU and Cambricon MLU. Guard vendor-specific code with `is_torch_npu_available()` / `IS_NPU_AVAILABLE` or `is_torch_mlu_available()` / `IS_MLU_AVAILABLE` (`veomni/utils/import_utils.py`, `veomni/utils/device.py`).
    - NPU kernels live in `veomni/ops/kernels/{rms_norm,rotary}/npu.py` and `veomni/ops/platform/npu/`; the MLU kernel is `veomni/ops/kernels/moe/mlu_group_gemm.py`. They must not be imported on a host without that vendor's runtime.
    - Device-type sets, not `== "cuda"`, decide dispatch: `MOE_TRITON_DEVICE_TYPES` in `veomni/utils/device.py` is `("cuda", "mlu")` today. Adding a backend means auditing those sets, not just adding a branch.

23. **Device-agnostic code must use `veomni.utils.device` helpers**
   - Use `get_device_type()`, `get_torch_device()`, `synchronize()`, `empty_cache()` instead of direct `torch.cuda.*` calls.
   - Direct CUDA calls break NPU and MLU compatibility.

## Trainer Extensions

24. **Trainer callback lifecycle changes must cover composed trainers**
   - `TextDPOTrainer` and `DiTTrainer` compose a `BaseTrainer` and override `forward_backward_step()`; they do not inherit the base implementation.
   - Lifecycle work added only inside `BaseTrainer.forward_backward_step()` is skipped by these trainers. Update every supported override or reject the unsupported trainer explicitly.

25. **Module-level OpSlots are shared by every model instance**
   - Modeling modules expose `OpSlot` objects such as `veomni_causal_lm_loss` as globals. Policy/reference models in DPO can therefore use the same slot.
   - Temporary interception must use forward-scoped ownership and reference-counted dispatch. A closure bound to one model or callback can observe another model's forward and corrupt side-channel state.

26. **DCP full resume skips HF weight materialization**
    - When `train.checkpoint.load_path` is set and the run is not LoRA/PEFT, `BaseTrainer` / omni train pass `should_skip_hf_weight_load=True` into `build_parallelize_model`, which forwards it to `parallelize_model_fsdp2` / `parallelize_model_ddp`.
    - The model is materialized without an HF weight read; parameters are restored by DCP in `CheckpointCallback.on_train_begin`.
    - Materialize through `_to_empty_preserving_nonpersistent_buffers()`, never bare `to_empty()`, on the random-init path as much as the resume path. `init_empty_weights()` patches `register_parameter` only, so a meta-built model holds *real* buffer values and `to_empty()` swaps every one for uninitialized memory. What restores them is narrower than it looks: DCP saves `state_dict()`, which omits `persistent=False`, and HF's `_init_weights` recomputes a rope table only for a module exposing `original_inv_freq` — which leaves Gemma3's per-layer-type `{type}_inv_freq`, its `embed_scale` and the Omni audio tower's sinusoidal `positional_embedding` with nothing behind them. A buffer built from a parameter is itself on meta, has no data to copy out of, and is skipped with a warning; no model registers one today. Note `veomni/models/module_utils.py` has the same unguarded pattern on the HF-load path.
    - LoRA/PEFT must not set `should_skip_hf_weight_load` (and `_materialize_and_load_weights()` raises if both are set): LoRA DCP is trainable-only and still needs the HF base from `model.model_path`.
    - After DCP load, `empty_cache()` is called to reduce first-step NCCL OOM risk from allocator fragmentation on near-OOM MoE jobs.

## Environment Reproducibility

27. **Exact uv synchronization removes separately installed overlays**
    - MagiAttention itself is the optional `--extra magi` extra (`uv sync --extra gpu --extra magi`).
      The SM90 CUTLASS overlay is then installed by `scripts/kernel/install_magi_sm90.sh`.

28. **In-place collective reductions in backward must own their gradient buffer**
    - Autograd can pass the same incoming gradient to multiple branches. `.contiguous()` does not copy an already contiguous tensor, so reducing that tensor in place can silently change a sibling branch's gradient and the caller's `grad_outputs`.
    - `_Gather.backward` uses NCCL reduce-scatter for nonempty real gradients with positive shard sizes. Equal shards use rank-major stacked tensor input to avoid the list API's internal flatten; uneven shards use the list path. Borrowed inputs require a separate output. Owned packed inputs may reuse the local rank's slice only where the old contiguous all-reduce result would also retain full storage; otherwise keep compact local storage. This avoids adding a local output allocation on top of a required full packing buffer. Other backends and complex/empty inputs retain an owned contiguous all-reduce buffer. `_GatherConcatSP.backward` also owns its in-place reduction buffer.
    - Collective selection must agree across ranks: negative-view flags and strides may differ by rank, so materialize them locally without changing the chosen collective. Preserve scaling before summation (FP16 overflow makes the order observable). The no-sum path scales only the local slice. Regression tests in `tests/parallel/ulysses/test_all_gather.py` cover shared gradients, edge cases, and local output storage with real Gloo/NCCL collectives where available.
    - A regression's reference collective must also use a contiguous buffer for NCCL. Make only the reference clone contiguous; preserve the layout of the actual incoming gradient so transposed, narrowed and expanded inputs remain covered.
