# DeepSeek-V4 Context Parallelism

Context parallelism (CP) is DeepSeek-V4's alternative to Ulysses for scaling
sequence length. Rank `r` of `cp_size` holds tokens `[r*L, (r+1)*L)` where
`L = S / cp_size`, keeps all attention heads, and computes attention only for its
own queries. The KV it hands to the sparse kernels — full-resolution and every
compressed part — is all-gathered, so it is byte-identical to the single-rank
one. That is the decisive property of the design: because the KV buffer is
replicated, every index the attention kernels consume stays global and needs no
remapping. Only the query axis is sharded.

It is selected with `model.accelerator.cp_size > 1` and `ulysses_size == 1`; the
two are mutually exclusive in milestone 1.

The constraints and tradeoffs below explain why this model uses CP instead of
Ulysses.

This document records what the code cannot tell you on its own: the constraints
it enforces and why they exist, the decisions that took more than one attempt,
the failure modes that hang rather than raise, and the questions that were left
open deliberately.

## Scope: what milestone 1 does and does not do

Milestone 1 buys numerical parity with very few moving parts, and accepts more
communication than necessary to get it.

| in | out (milestone 2 or later) |
|----|----|
| Contiguous sharding, `cp_size` in {2, 4} verified | Zigzag / load-balanced sharding |
| All-gather for full-resolution KV, compressed rows and compressor halos | P2P halos; multi-hop halos |
| DeepSeek-V4 only, via an allow-list | Any other model |
| GPU-only (`check_context_parallel_supported` rejects NPU) | Ascend/NPU CP |
| `cp_size > 1` with `ulysses_size == 1` | Hybrid CP x Ulysses |
| Training | KV cache and decode paths |
| Correctness | Measured performance; `cp_size=8` |

Anyone extending this should know what the contiguous layout is load-bearing
for: windows sort by start token and shards sort by rank, so concatenating each
rank's compressed rows in rank order already reproduces the global compressed
array with no restore permutation, and a local query row `i` is global row
`cp_rank * L + i` with no lookup. A striped or load-balanced layout invalidates
both, in the attention forward, in `shard_packed_compression_metadata` and in
the indexer independently — all three derive the shard's origin from
`cp_rank * local_seq_len` and nothing communicates it.

The safety net for any such change is `tests/parallel/context_parallel/`, which
compares forward output, input gradient and every parameter gradient against a
single-rank baseline at `cp_size` 2 and 4, packed and unpacked, with and without
the compressor. It needs four GPUs. `cp_size=8` has never been run.

## Constraints the code enforces

| constraint | enforced at | if violated |
|----|----|----|
| `cp_size <= S / max(config.compress_rates)` | `plan_compressor_shard`, called by all three window compressors before their halo exchange | `ValueError` on the first forward |
| `cp_size > 1` requires `ulysses_size == 1` | `ParallelState.__post_init__` and `AcceleratorConfig._resolve_topology` | `NotImplementedError` at launch |
| the model type must implement CP | `check_context_parallel_supported`, from `build_foundation_model` and `build_omni_model` | `NotImplementedError` at model build |
| CP is GPU-only | `check_context_parallel_supported` | `NotImplementedError` at model build on Ascend/NPU |
| explicit `position_ids` under either sequence-parallel mode | `DeepseekV4Model.forward` | `ValueError` on the first forward |
| the attention mask spans the full sequence | `DeepseekV4Attention.forward`, ahead of the KV all-gather | `ValueError` on the first forward |
| no KV cache under CP | `DeepseekV4Attention.forward` | `NotImplementedError` |
| shards are contiguous and equally sized, carrying global `position_ids` | not checkable from one rank; see below | silently wrong results |

Two of these are worth more than a table row.

### Sequence length and compression rate

`cp_size <= S / max(config.compress_rates)`, equivalently `L >= R` for every
configured compression rate. The largest rate is the binding one.

The reason is the halo geometry. A window owned by rank `r` can extend up to
`R - 1` tokens past the end of `r`'s shard, and the overlap half of `r`'s first
owned window begins `R` tokens before that window's start. Both are supplied by
`exchange_compressor_halos`, which reads the *immediately adjacent* ranks and
only those. If a shard is narrower than one rate, a window's tail or its
predecessor lands two or more ranks away and no halo carries it.

The practical risk is a short sequence with a wide rate. Production carries its
rates in the checkpoint's HF config, which is not vendored here, and a 512-wide
rate caps `cp_size` at `S/512` — at most 256 ranks at `S=131072` and at most 8
ranks at `S=4096`. There is no launch-time check, so an operator who exceeds it
learns so on step 1 of the job rather than at submission.

That is a deliberate decision rather than an omission, and worth knowing before
anyone "fixes" it. No single argument determines the width the guard checks: the
collator rounds the *actual* packed length up to a multiple of
`sp_size * sp_pad_scale`, while `data.max_seq_len` is a per-sample budget that
`train.pad_to_length` multiplies by `micro_batch_size` and that dynamic batching
need not reach. And the model config carrying `compress_rates` is not in scope
where those arguments are validated — `build_foundation_model` never receives a
sequence length. A launch-time check would therefore have to either re-derive the
collator's length arithmetic, giving a second and weaker copy of this constraint,
or thread a sequence length through model construction for one model's benefit.
The runtime guard checks the width that actually matters and names the caller
that hit it.

Lifting the constraint means multi-hop halos: exchanging with the
`ceil(R / L)` nearest neighbours instead of one, which changes
`exchange_compressor_halos` and the `+R` index rebase in
`rebase_window_indices` together. That is the same change that would replace the
all-gathers with P2P, so it belongs with milestone 2.

### The contiguous-equal-shard contract

Rank `r` receives rows `[r*L, (r+1)*L)` of the global sequence, contiguous and
equally sized, carrying their *global* `position_ids` (for packed data the
per-sample positions, which is what makes them global), while `cu_seq_lens_q`
still spans the whole packed batch. `SequenceParallelCollator` supplies this;
`DeepseekV4Attention.forward`, `shard_packed_compression_metadata` and
`DeepseekV4Indexer.forward` each reconstruct the shard's origin from it
independently.

No single rank can verify it. The one visible part is the attention forward's
mask-length check, which derives the global length as `local_seq_len * cp_size`
and therefore also catches an uneven split. Fabricated positions were a real
defect on this branch: `arange(local_seq_len)` tells every rank its shard starts
at position 0, which keeps every shape self-consistent while every rank above 0
compresses the wrong rows and the indexer's canonical-position check admits the
TileLang kernel on rank 0 alone. Hence the refusal rather than a default.

## Decisions that took more than one attempt

**Window ownership follows the first token.** Window `w` starting at token `s_w`
belongs to rank `s_w // L`, so it is computed by exactly one rank even when its
tokens span two. The alternative — aligning shard boundaries to window
boundaries — would require every packed sample length to be a multiple of the
compression rate, and the packed metadata deliberately supports arbitrary
lengths (`build_packed_compression_metadata` walks
`range(start, end - R + 1, R)` and drops the incomplete tail). Absorbing
straddling windows is what that choice buys, at the cost of two halos and
unequal per-rank window counts. The counts are not communicated: every rank
builds the same global `window_starts`, so every rank can compute every other
rank's count as pure local arithmetic.

**Pad-to-max gather is a performance choice, not a correctness one.** Ranks own
different numbers of windows, so each pads its compressed rows to
`n_max = max_r n_r` before the all-gather and slices the valid rows back out
afterwards. The branch first recorded that `_all_gather` *requires* equal
shapes; that was wrong — its own docstring says shards may differ in length, and
it exchanges shapes before allocating a tensor per rank. The padding stays for
the collective underneath: PyTorch's NCCL `all_gather` coalesces equally sized
outputs into a single `ncclAllGather` and degrades to one broadcast per rank
when they differ, which is `cp_size` launches per compressor and per indexer per
layer. The distinction matters to anyone reading this code: correctness holds
either way, so deleting the padding loses the coalesced collective rather than
gaining simplicity, and the wrong reason is what motivated threading `counts`
through the call in the first place. Unpadding is a deterministic index derived
from `window_starts`, so the gather stays differentiable and the padding rows
receive no gradient.

**The query axis had to be separated from the KV geometry.** The sparse index
builders read a single `seq_len` and used it for three roles that coincide under
Ulysses and separate under CP: the number of query rows, the absolute
full-resolution KV row of each sliding candidate, and the offset that lifts a
compressed slot into the concatenated KV buffer. Under CP the first becomes `L`
while the other two stay `S_global`, which is why
`build_packed_sparse_attention_indices` and `build_sparse_attention_indices`
take `query_offset` and `kv_full_len`. Both default to today's behaviour,
because every non-CP caller keeps the old signature — so the type system cannot
catch a missed call site. The same conflation was in the call site:
`compressed_len` was computed as `kv.shape[-2] - q.shape[-2]`, which under CP
evaluates to `S_global + C - L` instead of `C`, and is now carried explicitly
from the compressor. This whole class of error is silent. Shapes stay
self-consistent and the model attends to the wrong rows, so the mitigation is
the parity test that compares each shard's built indices against the matching
slice of the full-sequence build.

**Compressed slot values stay global; window token indices are rebased.** Two
index spaces look alike and must not be confused. Attention and indexer indices
— `topk_indices`, sliding-window indices, `range_starts` / `range_ends`,
`block_bias` columns — address the *replicated* global KV, so their values are
untouched under CP and the arrays are only sliced by query row. The compressor's
`window_indices` address the rank's own `kv` / `gate` tensors and so are rebased
by `cp_rank * L` **and** by the halo width, since they index
`[left halo | shard | right halo]`. `window_starts` is rebased by the shard
offset only, because it is used to index `position_ids`, which carries no halo.
`shard_packed_compression_metadata` applies all of this on the packed path; the
unpacked path rebases through `local_window_token_indices`.

## Failure modes that hang instead of raising

**Backward participation under CP is decided by the autograd graph.** A rank
that stops *reading* a gathered tensor never enters that gather's backward
all-reduce, and its peers wait out the NCCL watchdog — ten minutes of silence
rather than an assertion. This has cost the project time twice. First as a real
defect: a rank owning no compression window returned `new_zeros`, which is
detached. Then again while verifying that fix, when a mutation removing the right
halo hung instead of failing — rank 0 was the only rank then reading neither halo
(its left halo is the end-rank zero buffer), so the slab gather dropped out of
its graph, rank 0 completed its backward, and ranks 1 through 3 timed out in
`WorkNCCL(... ALLREDUCE ...)`.

`empty_compressed_rows` is the fix, and its shape is not incidental: it returns
empty slices of *both* `kv` and `gate` so the zero-window result stays attached
to both. Simplifying it back to `new_zeros`, or to a slice of `kv` alone,
reintroduces the hang — the second form subtly, since it leaves the kv halo's
gather reachable and only the gate halo's unreached. All three window
compressors and the packed compression helper call the one copy, because the
original fix reached one of four and missed the rest.

A sturdier design would gather `kv` and `gate` in one collective and slice, or
drop the autograd-function gather for explicit unconditional collectives. Both
touch `veomni/distributed/context_parallel/dsa_cp.py`.

The same property constrains tests: a CP test must finish every collective
before it asserts, or a genuine parity failure on one rank strands the others in
a watchdog timeout instead of reporting the mismatch.

**The TileLang indexer demotes silently.** `use_tilelang` is a conjunction of
runtime preconditions and falls back to the eager scorer rather than raising, so
a parity test can stay green while the kernel it exists to exercise stops
running. Any test claiming kernel coverage needs a pass-through counter to pin
it. Nothing currently runs the TileLang indexer inside a bf16 CSA layer under CP
— layer parity is float32 and the indexer's own test is a bare bf16 module — so
that pin is what a future test of that combination would need.

## Where the implementation diverged from the design and the plan

Recorded because the reasons were discoveries, not tidying.

| document said | built instead | why |
|----|----|----|
| `sharding.py` holds contiguous slice / restore helpers and a divisibility check `L % max_compress_rate == 0` | window-ownership arithmetic plus the three helpers every window compressor shares | Slicing is already free — the collator's `sp_slice` narrows on `sp_rank`, which resolves to `cp_rank` under CP — and contiguous shards in rank order need no restore permutation. The divisibility check was the wrong constraint: ownership by first token absorbs any sample length, so `L % R == 0` is not required, while `R <= L` is. |
| model-level validation belongs in the DSv4 forward, which raises if CP is enabled and the model is not DSv4 | positive allow-list `check_context_parallel_supported` in `veomni/models/auto.py`, called from `build_foundation_model`, plus a second call in `build_omni_model` | The design's own mitigation is self-contradictory: a forward that never runs cannot observe that the model is not DSv4. An allow-list also fails safe as CP spreads — a newly ported model has to be added deliberately instead of the gate having to be remembered. The omni call is keyed on the *foundation's* model type, because the encoder/decoder branch constructs `SeedOmniModel._from_config` directly and the outer `SeedOmniConfig` model type says nothing about what runs the collectives. |
| the plan scoped the CP admission gate to `parallel_state.py` | both `parallel_state.py` and `AcceleratorConfig._resolve_topology` | The arguments layer held its own model-agnostic `assert cp_size == 1`, which aborts on the CLI and trainer path before `ParallelState` is ever constructed. Two gates now carry the same hybrid-only refusal. |
| no `shard_packed_compression_metadata` | new helper in `packed_utils.py` | Only the module holding the hidden states knows they are one shard, so only it can shard the global metadata — and per-window and per-query arrays shard differently (see the decision on index spaces above). |
| "there is no sequence-length divisibility constraint beyond `S % cp_size == 0`" | `cp_size <= S / max(compress_rates)` | Found during implementation, from the halo geometry. See "Sequence length and compression rate". |

## Open questions

**The two gather implementations disagree about their gradient buffer.**
`_Gather.backward` all-reduces in place after a `.contiguous()`, which is a
no-op when the gradient is already contiguous and therefore leaves the reduce
writing into autograd's buffer; `_GatherConcatSP.backward` clones first. Neither
documents the precondition. `_Gather` is the one that is wrong, but the right
fix is a single non-in-place reduce in both, not a second clone — that is a
`sequence_parallel` concern and out of scope for CP. The history is worth
knowing before touching it: the `.contiguous()` was added, then reverted on the
rationale that no production caller reduces a gathered output with a bare
`.sum()`, which covered the stride-0 broadcast case but not the one that
actually bites — `torch.cat([kv, compressed_kv], dim=2)` handing backward a
narrowed view, contiguous only while `[B, 1, S, D]` collapses at batch 1 — and
was then restored with a batch-2 parity case pinning it. The line buys
contiguity and nothing else.

**The indexer's zero-window path cannot be backward-tested, and that is
temporary.** The indexer emits integer top-k indices and nothing downstream of
its compression is differentiable — its `index_scores` are discarded by the
`topk` on both the eager and TileLang paths, and its parameters receive no
gradient at all today. So its `exchange_compressor_halos` and
`all_gather_compressed_rows` have no backward on *any* rank: uniformly
unreachable from the loss, which is the one situation that cannot deadlock.
DeepSeek's own design gives the indexer an auxiliary loss. The day that lands,
those collectives acquire a backward and the indexer's zero-window path becomes
hang-class overnight; whoever adds the loss must add the backward coverage in
the same change. The unit test on `empty_compressed_rows` is what still holds in
the meantime.

**The omni wrapper under CP is untested.** The gate reads the foundation's model
type, so an omni model with a DeepSeek-V4 foundation is admitted. Whether the
wrapper's encoders — which process their own modality tokens around the
foundation — are CP-safe is unverified, and nothing exercises it. DeepSeek-V4
has no presence under `veomni/models/seed_omni/` today, so this is latent rather
than live.

**Performance is unmeasured.** The projected win over Ulysses (about 465 GB per
step down to about 7.4 GB, with both all-to-alls disappearing) is an estimate
from a production trace and kernel microbenchmarks, not a measurement of this
implementation. Three known costs are accepted by design in milestone 1: the
indexer is load-imbalanced, because every rank scores its queries against the
full global compressed array; a CSA layer pays two extra collectives, since the
compressor and its indexer compress the same windows at different head
dimensions and cannot share a result; and `exchange_compressor_halos`
all-gathers from every rank when only two neighbours are ever read.
`tests/models/test_model_forward_no_implicit_sync.py` does not exercise CP, so
the CP paths have no automated guard against device-to-host syncs.
