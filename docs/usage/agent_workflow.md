# Agent Workflow Guide

VeOmni provides a skill-based workflow system that helps AI coding agents work on the project effectively. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, so they work with any agent that implements it — no VeOmni-specific plugin required.

## Overview

The workflow consists of three layers:

```text
AGENTS.md                      <- Entry point: principles, skill dispatch, commit flow
.agents/skills/                <- Skills: step-by-step workflows for common tasks
.agents/knowledge/             <- Knowledge: constraints, architecture, dependency info
.cursor/rules/                 <- IDE rules: coding conventions, for editors that read them
```

When an agent opens the project, it reads `AGENTS.md` to understand:
- **What constraints to follow** before making any change
- **Which skill to use** for the task at hand
- **How to verify commits and review pull requests**

Some agents look for an entry point under a different filename. `CLAUDE.md` is a
symlink to `AGENTS.md` for that reason — there is one source of truth, and
adding another alias is just another symlink.

## Quick Start

### For AI Agent Users

How much of this is automatic depends on the agent. Reading `AGENTS.md` on
session start and auto-discovering skills from their `description` are both
capabilities the agent has to implement; where it does not, everything below
still works by invoking `/skill-name` explicitly.

1. The agent reads `AGENTS.md` on session start.
2. For each task, the agent selects the appropriate skill from the dispatch table (or auto-discovers it via the `description` frontmatter).
3. The agent reads the skill's `SKILL.md` and follows its step-by-step instructions.
4. Before opening a pull request and before pushing a substantive update to an open one, the agent runs `/veomni-review` over the branch diff, following its applicability rules.

**You don't need to do anything special** — just describe your task in natural language. You can also invoke a specific skill with `/skill-name` in chat (e.g., `/veomni-debug`).

### Examples

| What you say | Agent uses |
|---|---|
| "Add support for Llama 4" | `/veomni-new-model` |
| "Fix the OOM error in VLM training" | `/veomni-debug` |
| "Add a fused RoPE kernel" | `/veomni-new-op` |
| "Refactor the data collator" | `/veomni-develop` |
| "Update torch to 2.10" | `/veomni-uv-update` |
| "Write the patchgen config for Qwen3" | `/veomni-patchgen-model` |
| "Analyze this Chrome trace" | `/veomni-profile` |
| "Submit the current branch as a PR" | `/create-pr` |

## Directory Structure

### `.agents/skills/`

Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`):

```text
.agents/skills/
├── veomni-develop/SKILL.md    # Feature development and refactoring
├── veomni-debug/SKILL.md      # Bug fix and debugging (quick path + full protocol)
├── veomni-review/SKILL.md     # Pre-PR code review (mandatory)
├── veomni-new-model/SKILL.md  # Add a new model to VeOmni
├── veomni-patchgen-model/SKILL.md  # Author a model's patchgen-generated modeling
├── veomni-new-op/SKILL.md     # Add a new kernel/operator
├── veomni-uv-update/SKILL.md  # Dependency management with uv
├── veomni-profile/SKILL.md    # Performance profiling and optimization
└── create-pr/SKILL.md         # Create or update a pull request
```

The `description` field in frontmatter tells the agent when to apply the skill. Agents that support auto-discovery will offer the relevant skill automatically based on the task description.

### `.agents/knowledge/`

Domain knowledge that agents should read before making changes:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `constraints.md` | Hard constraints whose violation causes bugs or crashes |
| `architecture.md` | Module map, trainer hierarchy, data flow, model loading flow, test mapping |
| `cpu_only_env.md` | What can be verified on a machine with no GPU/NPU |
| `multimodal_metadata.md` | Canonical multimodal metadata keys and ownership boundaries |
| `testing.md` | How CI selects tests; whether a change needs one and where it goes |
| `uv.md` | Dependency management architecture (uv, extras, lockfile, torch sources) |

### `.cursor/rules/`

Editor rules, auto-applied when editing matching files by editors that read this
directory:

- `no-section-divider-comments.mdc` — no decorative `# ----` banners in Python
- `skills-reusable-only.mdc` — enforce Agent Skills standard format in `.agents/skills/`

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "When to use this skill. Trigger words and scenarios."
---
```

2. Add the skill to the dispatch table in `AGENTS.md`.
3. Add it to the Skill Index in `.agents/skills/README.md`.
4. If the skill needs domain knowledge, add it to `.agents/knowledge/`.
5. Optional: add `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` subdirectories.

See the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for the full format.

## Adding Domain Knowledge

1. Create or edit a `.md` file in `.agents/knowledge/`.
2. Reference it from the Context Loading section in `AGENTS.md`.
3. If the knowledge contains hard rules, add them to `constraints.md`.

## Commit and review flow

Run `/veomni-review` over the whole branch diff before opening a pull request
and again before pushing a substantive update to an open one. Follow the
skill's applicability rules, including self-checks for documentation-only changes:

```text
each commit    -> make quality + your own verification

before opening or substantively updating a PR
               -> /veomni-review -> Verdict
                                                |
                                        safe -> open or update the PR
                                 needs-attention -> fix, then open or update the PR
                                        risky -> report to user, wait
```

Additional gates:
- `make quality` must pass (ruff check + format) on every commit
- Commit messages describe the change, not the tool that produced it — no assistant or agent names, no `Co-Authored-By` trailers
- PR title must follow `[{modules}] {type}: {description}` format
