### Test

> Validation results (training curves, eval metrics) for changes not covered by CI.
> State which of the three applies: extended an existing CI-enumerated test, added a new test and wired it into the CI workflow that owns its path (a unit-test workflow, or `gpu_e2e_test.yml` / `npu_e2e_test.yml` for e2e), or no test needed (with the reason).

### Checklist Before Submitting

- Read the [Contribute Guide](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/VeOmni/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Applied pre-commit checks
- Added/updated documentation
- If `tasks/` training scripts were moved or renamed: updated `docs/` examples and verified `python3 scripts/ci/check_doc_task_paths.py` passes (also enforced by the **Check doc task paths** CI workflow)
- Tests: extended an existing CI-enumerated test, **or** added a new test and wired it into `gpu_unit_tests.yml` (and `npu_unit_tests.yml` where applicable), **or** explained in **Test** why none is needed. Note that CI enumerates test files individually — a new file outside `tests/data/` and `tests/ops/` does not run until it is listed. See [.agents/knowledge/testing.md](.agents/knowledge/testing.md).
