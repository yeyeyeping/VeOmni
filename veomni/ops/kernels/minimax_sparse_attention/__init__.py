"""MiniMax M3 sparse attention (MSA) operators on packed TND tensors.

The operator boundary follows the block-sparse kernel rather than the
Transformers reference code, so a kernel backend can replace the eager
implementation without touching the model:

``indexer(index_q, index_k, cu_seqlens, max_seqlen, *, block_size, topk_blocks, local_blocks)``
    ``index_q`` is ``[T, G, D]`` and ``index_k`` is ``[T, 1, D]`` (MQA), both
    after norm and RoPE. Returns ``[T, G, topk_blocks]`` int32 key-block
    indices, numbered within each sequence, left-packed with ``-1`` padding.

``attention(q, k, v, block_indices, cu_seqlens, max_seqlen, *, block_size, scale, dropout_p)``
    ``q`` is ``[T, Hq, D]`` and ``k``/``v`` are ``[T, G, D]`` without GQA
    repetition; query head ``h`` belongs to KV group ``h // (Hq // G)``.
    ``block_indices`` is the indexer output, or ``None`` for dense causal
    attention. Token-level causality inside a selected block is enforced by
    the operator. Returns ``[T, Hq, D]``.

``T`` is the full packed token count seen by this rank after the Ulysses
all-to-all, and ``cu_seqlens`` describes every packed sequence, including the
synthetic SP tail-padding sequence appended by the collator.
