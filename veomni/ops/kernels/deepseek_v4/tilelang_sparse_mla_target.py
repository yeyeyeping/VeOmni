"""Head-summed attention probability over the compressed slice, for the DSA
indexer loss (DeepSeek-V3.2 eq. 4).

This consumes the LSE that ``sparse_mqa_fwd_interface`` returns. That LSE is the
*full* CSA denominator: ``sparse_mqa_fwd_interface`` folds the attention sink
into ``sumexp`` before writing it (see ``tilelang_sparse_mla_fwd.py``, "attn_sink:
add exp(attn_sink[h] - max_scaled) to softmax denominator"), and the ``Indices``
it consumed spanned the sliding window as well as the compressed entries. That
is what makes the teacher produced here paper-correct rather than the
compressed-only approximation. If the sink ever moves out of ``sumexp``,
attention stays correct and this silently does not.
