"""Block-wise FP8 fake quantization for quantization-aware training.

QAT needs the forward pass to see exactly the values an FP8 inference kernel
would compute while the backward pass keeps updating BF16 master weights. Both
halves come from reusing the DeepSeek-V4 TileLang quantizers for the
quantize-dequantize round trip and wrapping them in a straight-through
estimator, which keeps training bit-aligned with inference by construction
instead of by a second, drifting reimplementation of the same numerics.

The backward pass is the usual straight-through approximation: a
quantize-dequantize round trip is a step function whose true derivative is zero
almost everywhere, so the gradient is passed through unchanged. What this
recipe does avoid is the *second* approximation that clipped quantizers need.
Every scale is derived from its own block's amax, and ``ue8m0`` rounds that
scale up, so ``x / scale`` stays inside the representable FP8 range and no
element sits in a saturated region whose gradient would have to be masked.

The TileLang quantizers are SM90-only and BF16-only, so every entry point here
inherits both restrictions.
