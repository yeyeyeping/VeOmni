    """DeepSeek-V4, plus the two fields of the Lightning Indexer KL objective.

    The objective is a training objective, not a kernel backend, so it is
    configured the way this model's other auxiliary objective already is:
    ``output_router_logits`` / ``router_aux_loss_coef`` are fields of the model
    config, folded into the loss in ``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM.forward`` from
    ``self.config``, and ``dsa_indexer_loss`` / ``dsa_indexer_loss_coef`` sit
    beside them and are read the same way. The neighbouring
    ``dsa_indexer_implementation`` / ``dsa_attention_implementation`` stay on
    ``OpsImplementationConfig``, which is kernel selection and nothing else.

    Being *declared* here is load-bearing rather than tidiness. Overrides from
    ``model.model_config`` reach the config as ``**kwargs`` to
    ``PreTrainedConfig.from_dict``, which applies only those keys the
    constructed config already answers ``hasattr`` for and drops the rest
    silently -- no error, no warning. An undeclared ``dsa_indexer_loss: true``
    would therefore parse, launch, train the language-model objective alone and
    report no indexer metric, which is the exact silent no-op every other gate
    in this feature exists to refuse. Declaring the two fields is what makes the
    YAML reach the model at all.

    Validated in ``validate_build_prerequisites`` below rather than in a
    ``__post_init__``: ``from_dict`` runs ``__post_init__`` on the on-disk values
    and only then ``setattr``s the overrides, so a bound checked there would see
    ``config.json`` and never the YAML that contradicts it.

        """Refuse a Lightning Indexer KL objective this run cannot actually train.

        ``build_foundation_model`` calls this on any config that defines it, once the
        config is finished and before any rank reads a weight -- 54.8 GB for
        DeepSeek-V4-Flash, which is the cost of learning from the first forward
        instead that three lines of YAML disagree with each other.

        It lives on the config rather than in ``veomni/models/auto.py`` because
        everything it knows is DeepSeek-V4's: two of its own fields, and which kernels
        those fields require. A generic model builder holding a list of model names is
        a list that the next model has to be remembered into. Here there is nothing to
        remember -- ``model.model_config`` is DeepSeek-V4's config precisely when the
        model is DeepSeek-V4.

        What it needs from outside is ``OpsImplementationConfig``: the objective's
        student distribution is the TileLang indexer's per-slot scores and its teacher
        is the TileLang sparse attention's log-sum-exp, and those two are kernel
        selections rather than model fields. Read off the installed singleton, not
        passed in, so that the hook stays a plain no-argument call that any config can
        implement.

        ``DeepseekV4Attention.forward`` refuses the same two on its first forward and
        that gate stays: it covers the paths that never come through
        ``build_foundation_model``, such as a test building a model straight from
        ``_from_config``.
