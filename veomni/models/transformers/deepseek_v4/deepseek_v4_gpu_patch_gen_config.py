Patch configuration for DeepseekV4 GPU patched modeling generation.

Regen command:
patchgen veomni.models.transformers.deepseek_v4.deepseek_v4_gpu_patch_gen_config -o veomni/models/transformers/deepseek_v4/generated --diff

Patches:
1. ``DeepseekV4Indexer.forward`` — optional TileLang Lightning Indexer for
   canonical CUDA prefill/training positions, selected by
   ``dsa_indexer_implementation=tilelang`` with eager cache/decode fallback.
   Under context parallelism it compresses its own windows and all-gathers the
   rows, keeping its compressed keys global while its queries stay local, and
   drops the Ulysses query partitioning.
2. ``eager_attention_forward`` — optional TileLang sparse MQA attention,
   selected by ``dsa_attention_implementation=tilelang``. Converts the
   upstream additive sliding/compressor mask into compact indices.
3. ``DeepseekV4Experts`` — drops upstream ``@use_experts_implementation``
   (which would otherwise dispatch to ``grouped_mm`` and bypass VeOmni's
   fused MoE kernel). Keeps the v5 stacked ``gate_up_proj [E, 2*I, H]`` /
   ``down_proj [E, H, I]`` layout and the gpt-oss-style ``swiglu_limit``
   clamp. Dispatch is OpSlot-guarded (``veomni_moe_experts_forward``):
   non-eager -> ``fused_moe_forward``; eager -> per-expert loop.
4. ``DeepseekV4RMSNorm`` / ``DeepseekV4UnweightedRMSNorm`` — functional
   OpSlot dispatch to Liger RMSNorm while preserving the two distinct class
   layouts. The unweighted form passes ``weight=None`` to Liger's supported
   non-affine path; eager keeps the official weighted FP32 multiply order.
5. ``DeepseekV4MLP.forward`` — shared experts always apply the official
   ``swiglu_limit`` clamp, then optionally fuse silu*mul via Liger when the
   SwiGLU OpSlot is non-eager. Routed experts remain on the fused-MoE path
   above so their clamp is kept there too.
6. ``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM.forward`` — OpSlot guard for fused
   cross-entropy (``veomni_causal_lm_loss``) + ``MoeCausalLMOutputWithLogProbs``
   so callers can read per-token log-probs / entropy alongside the loss.
7. ``DeepseekV4RotaryEmbedding.forward`` — retains FP32 cos/sin tables for
   official-compatible inference and casts them to the activation dtype during
   training so FSDP activation-checkpoint recomputation sees stable metadata.
8. ``DeepseekV4HyperConnections.pre`` / ``DeepseekV4HyperConnections.post`` /
   ``DeepseekV4HyperConnections.head`` — optional TileKernels mHC dispatch
   selected by ``mhc_implementation=tilelang``.
9. ``DeepseekV4Attention.forward`` — matches the official BF16 per-head Q
   normalization before RoPE, and adds both sequence-parallel modes: Ulysses
   SP (Q head all-to-all + MQA sequence all-gather around compressors /
   sparse attention) and context parallelism (sharded queries keeping every
   head, replicated MQA KV, and no output collective). Under CP the
   compressors and the Lightning Indexer shard their windows too, owning a
   window by its first token and all-gathering the compressed rows, so both
   layer types run.
10. ``DeepseekV4TopKRouter.forward`` / ``DeepseekV4HashRouter.forward`` —
   always perform the official FP32 router projection.
11. Register ``get_parallel_plan`` on ``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM``.
12. FP8 fake quantization for QAT, selected by
    ``qat_implementation=fp8_blockwise``. Four recipes, one per helper:

    - ``veomni_qat_linear`` — GEMM operands. Covers exactly the projections an
      FP8 inference kernel runs as a true FP8 GEMM: attention ``q_a_proj`` /
      ``q_b_proj`` / ``kv_proj`` / ``o_a_proj`` / ``o_b_proj``, the indexer's
      ``q_b_proj``, and the shared expert's ``gate_proj`` / ``up_proj`` /
      ``down_proj`` (128x128 weight tiles, 1x128 activation blocks).
    - ``veomni_qat_fake_quant_kv`` — attention KV entries as *stored*, which
      inference caches in FP8 and then attends to in BF16. NoPE channels only,
      1x64 blocks; applies to the live KV and to both compressors' output.
    - ``veomni_qat_fake_quant_act`` — activations whose every channel enters an
      FP8 product, 1x128 blocks over the whole last dimension. Two kinds of
      site: the indexer's Q and compressed K, whose logits are served as a real
      FP8 x FP8 product (DeepSeek's reference rotates by a Hadamard matrix and
      uses FP4 here; the SM90 target has no Hadamard), and the routed experts'
      input tokens.
    - ``veomni_qat_fake_quant_expert_weight`` — routed expert weights, on the
      fused-MoE path only, following the checkpoint's ``expert_dtype``: FP4 with
      ``[out, in/32]`` scales on V4-Flash, otherwise FP8 128x128 tiles.

    Left in the model dtype, because inference does not quantize them either:
    the main attention's Q (never stored, so it stays BF16 into attention), the
    fused-MoE output (inference combines the expert results in BF16, and the
    next FP8 GEMM quantizes its own input), the indexer's ``weights_proj``, all
    compressor ``kv_proj`` / ``gate_proj``, the mHC parameters and the MoE
    router.

    Two known gaps, both consequences of the routed experts living behind a
    fused kernel. The intermediate feeding the second expert GEMM is not
    quantized: it never leaves the fused MoE autograd function, so covering it
    would mean teaching shared MoE kernels this recipe. And the eager expert
    loop is not wired at all, so ``moe_implementation=eager`` trains the experts
    unquantized.

Intentionally NOT patched:

- Class-level ``LigerSwiGLUMLP`` / ``LigerRMSNorm`` replacement — keep the
  native V4 constructors (unweighted norm layout and shared-expert
  ``moe_intermediate_size`` mapping) and only swap arithmetic through OpSlots.
- ``apply_rotary_pos_emb`` — the generated definition stays the eager
  reference. DeepSeek-V4 uses a *partial* RoPE (the trailing
  ``qk_rope_head_dim`` slice only, with the leading nope channels untouched)
  plus an interleaved ``repeat_interleave(2)`` cos/sin layout that
  ``liger_rotary_pos_emb`` does not implement — SKILL.md flags this exact
  case (partial_rotary -> liger NaN) — so ``device_patch.py`` disables the
  registry-default Liger backend and offers a model-specific fused Triton
  kernel instead, selected by ``rotary_pos_emb_implementation=triton``.
  Because every call site (Q, MQA KV, the inverse rotation on the attention
  output, the indexer Q, and the compressors) resolves the module global,
  that one rebind covers all of them; ``compress_packed_windows`` takes it
  as an ``apply_rope`` argument for the same reason.
- ``DeepseekV4Attention.forward`` remains eager/TileLang-only
  (``_supports_flash_attn = False`` / ``_supports_sdpa = False`` /
  ``_supports_flex_attn = False``: ``head_dim=512`` exceeds FlashAttention's
  256 cap, SDPA lacks the per-head learnable sink, and FlexAttention can't
  resize BlockMask after the in-block compressor concatenation). MoE does not
  share this limitation: the experts patch above binds VeOmni fused MoE by
  default on GPU. Ulysses SP is handled inside the patched attention forward
  (head all-to-all on Q + sequence all-gather on MQA KV / compressor inputs)
  rather than via FA's ``veomni_flash_attention_*_with_sp`` path.

    """Whether to build the indexer KL, refusing loudly on unsupported setups.

    Silence is the failure mode worth designing against here: every unsupported
    configuration below would otherwise train the indexer on a wrong signal, or
    on none, while the loss curve looked entirely reasonable.

    Read off ``module.config``, where the objective and its weight are declared,
    beside the ``output_router_logits`` / ``router_aux_loss_coef`` pair this model's
    other auxiliary objective is configured through and folded in from. ``module`` is
    therefore anything holding the model config -- a ``DeepseekV4Attention`` or the
    ``DeepseekV4Model`` itself. Per-instance rather than module-global, so two models
    built from this one generated module (a DPO policy and its reference) can differ.

    ``getattr`` with a default, not attribute access: ``MODELING_BACKEND=hf`` skips
    ``MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY`` and hands the patched classes an upstream
    ``DeepseekV4Config``, which declares neither field. Undeclared is not the same as
    absent, though, and the difference is exactly what the subclass buys. Keys found
    in a ``config.json`` are ``setattr``ed by ``from_dict`` whether the class declared
    them or not, so a flag-on checkpoint carries the objective into an upstream config
    unaided; a *kwarg* is applied only if the attribute already exists, so enabling the
    objective from YAML on a base checkpoint that never had the key is the one path
    that silently drops without the declaration. What the default here covers is the
    remaining case -- neither declared nor on disk -- where off is the only safe
    reading of a config that cannot express the objective.

    A non-positive coefficient counts as off, matching Megatron's
    ``coeff is not None and coeff > 0`` (``training/training.py:3317``). It is read
    here rather than only at the fold-in because this predicate is what decides the
    teacher recompute as well: ``loss + 0.0 * kl`` is the right *value* while still
    building the graph, so the backward writes a zero ``p.grad`` onto every indexer
    parameter -- and Muon skips only ``p.grad is None`` (``muon.py:902``) while
    ``_apply_ortho`` decays whatever it steps (``:1005-1006``), which is weight decay
    on 226M otherwise-frozen parameters, at the full cost of the teacher kernel.
    Gating here makes ``dsa_indexer_loss_coef: 0.0`` cost exactly what
    ``dsa_indexer_loss: false`` costs.

    Before the refusals below, not after: a user who switched the term off with the
    coefficient has not asked for a TileLang indexer, and refusing their run over the
    configuration of a feature they just disabled would be advice about the wrong
    thing.

    ``DeepseekV4Config.validate_build_prerequisites`` refuses the two implementation fields at
    model-build time, before any rank reads a weight, so a launched run is told there
    rather than here. These stay because this predicate also covers the paths that
    never pass through ``build_foundation_model`` -- a model constructed straight from
    ``_from_config`` -- and because the parallel-state refusals below have no earlier
    home: the state is installed by then, but a model-agnostic gate cannot know that

    the attention forward that returns the extra values, the decoder layer that
    unpacks them, and the model loop that accumulates them -- and they are in three
    different functions. They read this predicate rather than each re-deriving the
    condition, because a copy that goes stale in any one of them is an arity
    mismatch: gating the decoder layer on ``_indexer_loss_enabled`` alone would
    four-unpack the two-tuple every sliding and HCA layer returns, which is three
    of the four layers of the reference checkpoint.

    The attention forward also hands its answer *down*, to the compressor and the
    indexer, whose returns change arity by the same decision (``_split_indexer_output``).
    They are passed it rather than calling this because neither keeps the model config
    the predicate reads, and because one evaluation per layer per forward is one fewer
    thing that can disagree with itself mid-call.

    ``_indexer_loss_enabled`` comes first so that its refusals fire on every layer

    the loss but built without a single CSA layer would otherwise accept the flag

    their two-value return -- only a CSA layer carries a Lightning Indexer, so only
    it has a student to train, and the others' compressors hand back a perfectly
    ordinary ``CompressedCandidates`` carrying causal ranges instead of scores.

    The test is on the layer type rather than on ``module.compressor.indexer``
    existing, because the two fail in opposite directions. ``layer_type`` comes
    from the checkpoint's ``layer_types``, so a rename of the compressor's
    attribute breaks the KL loudly at the attribute access in the attention
    forward; keying the gate on that attribute's *name* would instead turn the

# ================================================================
# Patch: DeepseekV4Indexer.forward
# 1. Dispatch CUDA prefill/training index scoring to the TileLang Lightning
#    Indexer when ``dsa_indexer_implementation=tilelang``. Cache/decode and unusual
#    position layouts fall outside what that kernel accepts, and having been asked
#    for it explicitly this refuses rather than demoting to the eager scorer.
# 2. Context parallelism: compress this shard's own windows and all-gather the
#    compressed rows, so the keys stay global while the queries stay local, and
#    drop the Ulysses query partitioning, which has nothing left to do.
# 3. Under ``dsa_indexer_loss``, hand the per-slot index scores back next to the
#    selection so the auxiliary KL has a student to train, and detach the inputs so
#    that KL cannot reach the main model. The eager scorer discards those scores and
#    so cannot serve the objective, but needs no refusal of its own here: the gate
#    admits the objective only under ``tilelang``, and the dispatch refusal in (1)
#    then covers every call that TileLang cannot take.

# ================================================================
# Patch: DeepseekV4Attention.forward
# 1. Pass the collator-provided packed sequence slices into compressors.
# 2. Ulysses SP: all-to-all Q heads, sequence all-gather for MQA KV and
#    compressor inputs (windows/indexers need the full sequence), then
#    scatter attention outputs back to the local sequence shard.
# 3. Context parallelism: shard the queries instead of the heads and
#    replicate the MQA KV, so both Ulysses all-to-alls disappear and the
#    sparse indices keep addressing global KV rows.
# 4. Under ``dsa_indexer_loss`` on a CSA layer, return the indexer KL and its
#    zero-information reference as third and fourth values. The return
#    annotation states that arity, so a caller reads the contract off the
#    signature rather than off a comment -- keep the two in step.

#    arity, so a caller reads the contract off the signature rather than off a

# 1. Drop upstream ``@use_experts_implementation`` decorator — it would
#    dispatch to ``grouped_mm`` / HF fused paths and bypass VeOmni's fused
#    MoE kernel.
# 2. OpSlot guard for fused-MoE: when ``veomni_moe_experts_forward`` is
#    bound to a non-eager kernel, call ``fused_moe_forward`` with stacked
#    ``gate_up_proj`` and pass ``swiglu_limit`` explicitly. Otherwise fall
#    through to the eager loop.
# 3. Preserve V4's gpt-oss-style ``swiglu_limit`` clamp on gate / up
#    pre-activations (paper §2.1 — required for V4's training stability).
# Layout matches v5 upstream (direct, no transpose):
