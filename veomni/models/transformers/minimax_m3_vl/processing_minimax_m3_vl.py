"""VeOmni's MiniMax M3 VL processor.

Registered in ``MODEL_PROCESSOR_REGISTRY`` under both the upstream class name
and the name the checkpoint's bundled ``processing_minimax.py`` uses, so a
MiniMax M3 run always gets this class regardless of which one ``AutoProcessor``
resolved from the checkpoint.

    """MiniMax M3 VL processor built purely from the transformers-native classes.

    VeOmni pins MiniMax M3 to the transformers>=5.12 implementation -- that is
    what the generated modeling and the HF parity test are written against -- and
    the checkpoint's bundled ``processing_minimax.py`` is unusable regardless: its
    ``MiniMaxVLProcessor.__init__`` drops ``**kwargs`` and so loses the
    ``chat_template.jinja`` that ``from_pretrained`` passes through, and its
    ``preprocessor_config.json`` declares the image/video processors *only* via a
    ``trust_remote_code`` ``auto_map``.

    So this class never runs the bundled code and never goes through
    ``AutoProcessor`` / ``ProcessorMixin.from_pretrained``. It builds the tokenizer
    and the native image/video processors by their concrete class -- each of which
    reads all of its parameters from the checkpoint's own config files -- and takes
    the chat template straight from the tokenizer, which is the one component that
    parses both ``chat_template.jinja`` and a ``tokenizer_config.json`` template.
