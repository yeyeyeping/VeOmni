"""Tests for ``outputs.aux_metrics`` on the trainer's reporting path.

``loss_dict`` carries a reduction contract a diagnostic does not share: every
entry is pre-weighted by its share of the step's tokens, so ``postforward``
summing it yields the backward scalar and ``train_step`` summing it across micro
batches yields the step's mean loss. Both summations are wrong for a metric — the
first would fold it into the objective, the second would report it
``gradient_accumulation_steps`` times too large — so metrics travel in their own
dict and are averaged instead. These tests pin that separation end to end, the
averaging, and the route to the ``training/<key>`` name that reaches wandb.
