"""The context-parallel model gate must not construct a parallel state.

``check_context_parallel_supported`` runs for every model and asks
``get_parallel_state()`` whether CP is on. In a process that never installed a
state, that accessor does not return ``None`` -- it *builds* a default
single-process ``ParallelState``, whose ``dp_size=1`` contradicts a multi-rank
world and so raises on the topology product check. That turned any multi-rank
process which builds a model without installing a state into a hard failure;
``tests/lora/test_moe_lora_ep2.py`` is one, spawning two ranks and calling
``build_foundation_model`` directly.

GPU CI caught this and the unit tests did not, because every one of them stubbed
the accessor. Hence the one thing worth pinning here is the case where nothing
is stubbed.
