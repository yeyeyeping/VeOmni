    ``seq_len`` 160 gives ``L=40``, which is not a multiple of the toy HCA rate
    of 32 but is wider than it, so the narrow-shard guard admits it and the
    compressor runs. Window starts are [0, 32, 64, 96, 128] and the owners are
    [0, 0, 1, 2, 3], so the ranks own unequal numbers of them and the window at
    32 covers 32..63, crossing the rank 0/1 edge at 40 -- unpacked straddling,
    which an aligned length cannot produce because there every window sits
    inside one shard.

    Sequence length is the only free variable here: with four ranks, ``L`` must
    exceed 32 to keep the compressor and must not be a multiple of 32 to be
    misaligned, so 160 is the shortest sequence that satisfies both.

    This is what replaces the guard that used to refuse an indexer-bearing

    array must be the same length, and in the same order, as the compressor's, or
    a top-k value names a different slot on each side.

    Sequence length 128 with the toy CSA rate of 4 gives 32 compressed slots
